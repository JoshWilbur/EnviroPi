# EnviroPi
EnviroPi is a continuation of my Raspberry Pi weather station class project. Previous code was cleaned up and the display output was redone to improve functionality. This project is a work in progress but is in a functional state.

# Hardware
* Raspberry Pi 0W
* ADA1893 temperature/pressure sensor
* 1.8" ST7735 TFT display
* Solderless breadboard and jumper wires

# Software
As stated above, this is a continuation of an existing project. The code is modified to fix some bugs but the overall structure is similar. A library, authored by Gavin Lyons, was used to interface with the TFT display.

# Future Work 
Currently, the device only uses one sensor. Additional sensors to capture more environmental statistics will be added eventually. A 3D printed case and PCB for the components will be made once more improvements are done. Graphing will be added to show trends in readings.
